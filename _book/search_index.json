(2019): Biofidelity Evaluation of GHBMC Male Occupant Models in Rear Impact The NHTSA Biofidelity Ranking System was used to evaluate the HBMs. The HBMs exhibited better biofidelity 1) at 17 km/h than 24 km/h, and 2) in the head to T1 region, which is relevant to rear-impact-related injuries, than the T1 to pelvis region. The detailed HBM received a better biofidelity score than the simplified HBM in every studied component. Limitations for the HBMs’ biofidelity were indicated in the modelling of their spines and surrounding flesh. 2.2 Frontal impact Tang, Zheng, and Hu (2020): A numerical investigation of factors affecting lumbar spine injuries in frontal crashes #HIII Parametric simulations were conducted using a set of validated vehicle driver compartment model, restraint system model, and a HIII mid-size male crash test dummy model. Risk factors considered in the study included occupant seating posture, crash pulse, vehicle pitch angle, seat design, anchor pre-tensioner, dynamic locking tongue, and shoulder belt load limiter. Devane, Johnson, and Gayzik (2019): Validation of a simplified human body model in relaxed and braced conditions in low-speed frontal sled tests #GHBMC Hu et al. (2019): Frontal crash simulations using parametric human models representing a diverse population Frontal crash simulations based on U.S. New Car Assessment Program (U.S. NCAP) were conducted. Body region injury risks were calculated based on the risk curves used in the US NCAP, except that scaling was used for the neck, chest, and knee–thigh–hip injury risk curves based on the sizes of the bony structures in the corresponding body regions. Age effects were also considered for predicting chest injury risk. Results: The simulations demonstrated that driver stature and body shape affect occupant interactions with the restraints and consequently affect occupant kinematics and injury risks in severe frontal crashes. U-shaped relations between occupant stature/weight and head injury risk were observed. Chest injury risk was strongly affected by age and sex, with older female occupants having the highest risk. A strong correlation was also observed between BMI and knee–thigh–hip injury risk, whereas none of the occupant parameters meaningfully affected neck injury risks. 2.3 Side Impact (???): Methodology for the Evaluation of Human Response Variability to Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors Including Uncertainties Hwang, Hu, and Reed (2019): Diverse Human Body Models against Side Impact Tests with Post-Mortem Human Subjects Dual-sled model validated with SID, SID-II: Hwang et al. (2016) (Development, Evaluation, and Sensitivity Analysis of Parametric Finite Element Whole-Body Human Models in Side Impacts) With weight, stature, sex, and age of PMHS, seven FE HBMs were developed by morphing the midsize male THUMS model into the target geometries predicted by the statistical skeleton and external body shape models. The model-predicted force histories, accelerations a long the spine, and deflections in the chest and abdomen were compared to the test data. For comparison, simulations in all testing conditions were also conducted with the original midsize male THUMS, and the results from the THUMS simulations were scaled to the weight and stature from each PMHS. (Hwang, Hu, and Reed 2019) 2.4 Oblique Impact Perez-Rapela et al. (2019): Comparison of the simplified GHBMC to PMHS kinematics in far-side impact Results show that, in general, the simplified GHBMC captures lateral excursion in oblique impact conditions but overpredicts in purely lateral impact conditions. The simplified GHBMC shows post-mortem human subject like sensitivities to changes in ΔV and the use of pretensioner but no sensitivity to changes in impact direction. The human body model performs similarly to other previously published HBMs and obtains a “good” CORA score. However, the surrogate does not represent post-mortem human subject shoulder-to-belt interaction in all configurations. 2.5 Vulnerable population Larsson et al. (2019): Evaluation of the Benefits of Parametric Human Body Model Morphing for Prediction of Injury to Elderly Occupants in Side Impact Side-impact sled tests conducted with these PMHS were recreated by means of simulations with the baseline and morphed HBMs. Results showed that the parametrically morphed models showed improved correlation with PMHS kinematics compared with the baseline HBM predictions and performed as well as the further personalized models. Both parametric and personalized HBMs failed to predict the PMHS chestband deflection magnitudes and predicted no risk for rib fractures. In contrast, both PMHS sustained multiple fractured ribs during testing. In conclusion, parametric HBM morphing alone improved prediction of individual kinematics, but neither morphing method improved individual injury risk prediction. 2.6 Future Seat Configurations Boyle (2019): A Human Modelling Study on Occupant Kinematics in Highly Reclined Seats during Frontal Crashes Rawska et al.

In this report we compared these high speed human volunteer test results with our previous work and concluded the excursion of human volunteer is less than the excursion of PMHS at higher speeds, mimicking the findings at lower speeds. 3.1.1 Restraint systems (Reed, Ebert, and Jones 2019) : Posture and belt fit in reclined passenger seats Regression analysis demonstrated that the pelvis rotated rearward and lumbar spine flexion decreased with increasing recline. The lap portion of the 3-point belt was more rearward relative to the pelvis in more-reclined postures, and the torso portion crossed the clavicle closer to the midline of the body. Regression equations were developed to predict posture and belt fit variables as a function of passenger characteristics, seat back angle, and the use of the headrest. 3.1.2 Precrash Graci et al.

["head.html", "Chapter 4 Head 4.1 Brain", " Chapter 4 Head Bruneau and Cronin (2019): Head and Neck Response of an Active Human Body Model and Finite Element Anthropometric Test Device During a Linear Impactor Helmet Test Although responses that develop over longer durations following the impact differed slightly, such as the moment at the base of the neck, this occurred later in time, and therefore, did not considerably affect the short-term head kinematics in the primary impact direction. Though muscle activation did not play a strong role in the head response for the test configurations considered, muscle activation may play a role in longer duration events. Miller et al. (2019): An envelope of linear and rotational head motion during everyday activities The peak resultant linear accelerations of the head reported in the literature were all less than 15 g, while the peak resultant rotational accelerations and rotational velocities approach 1375 rad/s2 and 12.8 rad/s, respectively.

(2018): quantitative analysis of the effects of boundary conditions and brain tissue constitutive model, Prediction of brain deformations and risk of traumatic brain injury due to closed-head impact #THUMS4 The brain–skull interface models included direct representation of the brain meninges and cerebrospinal fluid, outer brain surface rigidly attached to the skull, frictionless sliding contact between the brain and skull, and a layer of spring-type cohesive elements between the brain and skull. We considered Ogden hyperviscoelastic, Mooney–Rivlin hyperviscoelastic, neo–Hookean hyperviscoelastic and linear viscoelastic constitutive models of the brain tissue. Our study indicates that the predicted deformations within the brain and related brain injury criteria are strongly affected by both the approach of modelling the brain–skull interface and the constitutive model of the brain parenchyma tissues. 4.1.2 Experiments Li et al.

While glenoid inclination showed the highest impact on joint stability with increasing upward-tilting causing cranial subluxation, changing of the lateral acromial coverage or acromial height had less influence on stability but showed significant alteration of joint reaction forces.

(2020): Effects of sex, age, and two loading rates on the tensile material properties of human rib cortical bone There were no significant differences in material properties between sexes and no significant interactions between age and sex. Spearman correlation analyses showed that all material properties had significant negative correlations with age at 0.005 strain/s except modulus. At 0.5 strain/s, all material properties except yield strain had significant negative correlations with age. Although the results revealed that the material properties of human rib cortical bone varied significantly with respect to chronological age, the R2 values only ranged from 0.15 to 0.62, indicating that there may be other underlying variables that better account for the variance within a given population.

Fracture characteristics (location, classification, number, and severity) were analyzed utilizing a new classification system. Structural properties (peak and yield force, %peak and yield displacement, linear structural stiffness, total energy, plastic energy, and ductility/brittleness) were calculated from test data for each rib and their relationships with fracture characteristics were assessed. Three structural properties (%peak displacement, total energy, and plastic energy) were found to have significant differences with all fracture characteristics except fracture location. However, the significant differences were only found in specific comparisons within each fracture characteristic. Fracture location was only found to have a significant relationship with % peak displacement. 7.2 Internal organ injuries References "],
