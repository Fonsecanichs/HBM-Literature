  abstract        = {There is currently no injury assessment for thoracic or lumbar spine fractures in the motor vehicle crash standards throughout the world. Compression-related thoracolumbar fractures are occurring in frontal impacts and yet the mechanism of injury is poorly understood. The objective of this investigation was to characterize these injuries using real world crash data from the US-DOT-NHTSA NASS-CDS and CIREN databases. Thoracic and lumbar AIS vertebral body fracture codes were searched for in the two databases. The NASS database was used to characterize population trends as a function of crash year and vehicle model year. The CIREN database was used to examine a case series in more detail. From the NASS database there were 2000-4000 occupants in frontal impacts with thoracic and lumbar vertebral body fractures per crash year. There was an increasing trend in incidence rate of thoracolumbar fractures in frontal impact crashes as a function of vehicle model year from 1986 to 2008; this was not the case for other crash types. From the CIREN database, the thoracolumbar spine was most commonly fractured at either the T12 or L1 level. Major, burst type fractures occurred predominantly at T12, L1 or L5; wedge fractures were most common at L1. Most CIREN occupants were belted; there were slightly more females involved; they were almost all in bucket seats; impact location occurred approximately half the time on the road and half off the road. The type of object struck also seemed to have some influence on fractured spine level, suggesting that the crash deceleration pulse may be influential in the type of compression vector that migrates up the spinal column. Future biomechanical studies are required to define mechanistically how these fractures are influenced by these many factors.},

  abstract  = {Automated vehicles introduce the potential for non-traditional seating postures, including various degrees of recline. To date, there have been no human surrogate studies in the literature describing reclined occupant response in frontal or other crashes, which suggests that new biofidelity reference targets are needed to evaluate anthropomorphic test device (ATD) and human body model (HBM) predictions. The goal of this study was to develop and demonstrate a methodology for performing biofidelity reference tests for reclined occupants that incorporate methods for capturing these complex kinematics and kinetics. The test methodology developed here is demonstrated with a frontal impact sled test performed with one post mortem human surrogate (PMHS). A simplified, generic, semi-rigid seat pan and minimal back support (at 50 degrees reclined with the vertical) was used to support the occupants as they underwent a 50 km/h crash pulse while restrained with a three pretensioner force-limited seat-integrated belt restraint. Occupant kinematics, seat deflections, belt spool-in and spool-out, and buck motion were collected with an optoelectronic motion tracking system and lumbar spine and pelvic load timing were collected with additional instrumentation. Boundary conditions are critical for finite element (FE) model validation. The forces beneath the seat pan, toe pan and buckle were measured in 6 degrees of freedom (DOF). Additionally, the forces at the lap belt and shoulder belt were measured. This is the first effort in the field to develop and evaluate a methodology for reclined occupant biofidelity reference testing, which can (and will) be used for: i) additional PMHS testing to generate biofidelity reference targets for assessing the performance of occupant models in reclined postures; and can also be extended to: ii) generate reference data for other reclined configurations and iii) to assess the performance of new and novel restraint system designs.},

  abstract = {While abnormal loading is widely believed to cause cervical spine disc diseases, in vivo cervical disc deformation during dynamic neck motion has not been well delineated. This study investigated the range of cervical disc deformation during an in vivo functional flexion–extension of the neck. Ten asymptomatic human subjects were tested using a combined dual fluoroscopic imaging system (DFIS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based three-dimensional (3D) modeling technique. Overall disc deformation was determined using the changes of the space geometry between upper and lower endplates of each intervertebral segment (C3/4, C4/5, C5/6, and C6/7). Five points (anterior, center, posterior, left, and right) of each disc were analyzed to examine the disc deformation distributions. The data indicated that between the functional maximum flexion and extension of the neck, the anterior points of the discs experienced large changes of distraction/compression deformation and shear deformation. The higher level discs experienced higher ranges of disc deformation. No significant difference was found in deformation ranges at posterior points of all the discs. The data indicated that the range of disc deformation is disc level dependent and the anterior region experienced larger changes of deformation than the center and posterior regions, except for the C6/7 disc. The data obtained from this study could serve as baseline knowledge for the understanding of the cervical spine disc biomechanics and for investigation of the biomechanical etiology of disc diseases. These data could also provide insights for development of motion preservation surgeries for cervical spine.},
