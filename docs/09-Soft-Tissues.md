Zhai, 2019[@Zhai2019]: Mechanical Response of Human Muscle at Intermediate Strain Rates

>  tensile stress–strain response of human muscle along fiber direction and compressive stress–strain response transverse to fiber direction at intermediate strain rates (100–102/s). An Ogden model with two material constants was adopted to describe the nonlinear tensile and compressive behaviors of human muscle.
