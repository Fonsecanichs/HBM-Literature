- Bareiss, 2020 [@Bareiss2020]: Estimating near side crash injury risk in best performing passenger vehicles in the United States

> This work suggests that injury risk in near-side impacts is higher when crash delta-v is higher, the occupant is over the age of 65, the occupant is female, the occupant’s BMI is higher, or the occupant’s vehicle received a lower score in the NCAP MDB test.

- Lidbe, 2020[@Lidbe2020]: Do {NHTSA} vehicle safety ratings affect side impact crash outcomes?
> The upper and lower extremities were frequently injured body regions in side impact crashes.
> head and thorax are the most common regions of impact of severe injuries, while the neck is the least.

- Jermakian, 2019[@Jermakian2019]: Factors contributing to serious and fatal injuries in belted rear seat occupants in frontal crashes
> Rear seat occupants sustained serious and fatal injuries due to belt loading in crashes in which front seat occupants survived, suggesting a discrepancy in restraint performance between the front and rear rows. Restraint strategies that reduce loading to the chest should be considered, but there may be potential tradeoffs with increased head excursion, particularly in the absence of rear seat airbags. Any new restraint designs should consider the unique needs of the rear seat environment.

- Rizzi, 2020 [@Rizzi2020]: The potential of different countermeasures to prevent injuries with high risk of health loss among bicyclists in Sweden

> Improved maintenance by deicing and removal of snow from bicycle infrastructure was found to have the highest potential (8%), followed by improved **crashworthiness of passenger cars (5%)** and safer bicycle crossings (4%).
