# Data Analysis

## Crash data analysis

- Bareiss, 2020 [@Bareiss2020]: Estimating near side crash injury risk in best performing passenger vehicles in the United States

> This work suggests that injury risk in near-side impacts is higher when crash delta-v is higher, the occupant is over the age of 65, the occupant is female, the occupant’s BMI is higher, or the occupant’s vehicle received a lower score in the NCAP MDB test.


- Pipkorn, 2020 [@Pipkorn2020]: Occupant injuries in light passenger vehicles: A {NASS} study to enable priorities for development of injury prediction capabilities of human body models

- Miller, 2020[@Miller2020]: Patient Age Is Inversely Associated with Injury Counts Caused by Motor Vehicle Crashes.

## Vulnerable Road Users

-  Meredith, 2020[@Meredith2020]: Mapping fractures from traffic accidents in Sweden: How do cyclists compare to other road users?

- Rizzi, 2020 [@Rizzi2020]: The potential of different countermeasures to prevent injuries with high risk of health loss among bicyclists in Sweden

> Improved maintenance by deicing and removal of snow from bicycle infrastructure was found to have the highest potential (8%), followed by improved **crashworthiness of passenger cars (5%)** and safer bicycle crossings (4%).

## Falls
