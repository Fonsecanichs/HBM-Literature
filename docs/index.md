# Human Body Models: Scientific Literature Collection

**A curated list of recent  literature on injury biomechanics, mostly focused on vehicle/mobility-related safety**

Ever read something or come across something useful, (almost) never to find it later when you need it? This started as a notebook to document interesting literature that I come across in my research work.

## New articles

- Connor, 2020[@Connor2020]: Inertial properties of a living population for the development of biofidelic headforms
> The linear equations associated with this new primary data set relate head circumference to head mass and moments of inertia: Head Mass = 0.18 × Head Circumference – 6.08, where mass is in kg and circumference is in cm, while Ixx = 79.88 × Head Mass – 132.88, Iyy = 81.70 × Head Mass – 128.38 and Izz = 53.88 × Head Mass – 86.66, where I is the moment of inertia in kg/cm2 and mass is in kg.
