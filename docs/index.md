# Human Body Models: Scientific Literature Collection

**A curated list of recent  literature on injury biomechanics, mostly focused on vehicle/mobility-related safety**

Ever read something or come across something useful, (almost) never to find it later when you need it? This started as a notebook to document interesting literature that I come across in my research work.
