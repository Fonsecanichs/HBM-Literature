> There were no significant differences in material properties between sexes and no significant interactions between age and sex.

>Spearman correlation analyses showed that all material properties had significant negative correlations with age at 0.005 strain/s except modulus. At 0.5 strain/s, all material properties except yield strain had significant negative correlations with age. Although the results revealed that the material properties of human rib cortical bone varied significantly with respect to chronological age, the R2 values only ranged from 0.15 to 0.62, indicating that there may be other underlying variables that better account for the variance within a given population.

- Harden, 2019 [@Harden2019]: Human Rib Fracture Characteristics and Relationships with Structural Properties

> Ribs (n=347) were impacted in a dynamic bending scenario representing a frontal thoracic impact. Fracture characteristics (location, classification, number, and severity) were analyzed utilizing a new classification system.
Structural properties (peak and yield force, %peak and yield displacement, linear structural stiffness, total energy, plastic energy, and ductility/brittleness) were calculated from test data for each rib and their relationships with fracture characteristics were assessed. Three structural properties (%peak displacement, total energy, and plastic energy) were found to have significant differences with all fracture characteristics except fracture location. However, the significant differences were only found in specific comparisons within each fracture characteristic. Fracture location was only found to have a significant relationship with % peak displacement.
