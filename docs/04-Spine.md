> Changing posture from standing to sitting decreased CL by an average of 5.3°, slightly decreased TK by an average of 1.3°, increased TLK by an average of 6.8°, decreased LL by an average of 35°, decreased SS by an average of 49.2°, increased PT by an average of 49.2°, shifted C7-SVA backward by an average of 106.7 mm, decreased T1SPI by an average of 18.8°, and increased TPA by an average of 21.1°.

- Simond, 2019[@Simond2019]: Discovery of a New Ligament of the Lumbar Spine: The Midline Interlaminar Ligament

> Twenty-six out of thirty-four (76.5%) lumbar levels were found to have a MIL traveling on the internal aspect of the most medial aspect of the laminae and positioned slightly anterior to the plane of the ligamenta flava.
The mean length and width of the MIL were 9.03±4.29 mm and 4.94±1.56 mm, respectively. The mean force necessary until failure for the MIL was 12.3N.

> Parametric simulations were conducted using a set of validated vehicle driver compartment model, restraint system model, and a HIII mid-size male crash test dummy model. Risk factors considered in the study included occupant seating posture, crash pulse, vehicle pitch angle, seat design, anchor pre-tensioner, dynamic locking tongue, and shoulder belt load limiter.
